            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Stanny Ho, a master's student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at the National
                Taiwan
                University of Science and Technology. My research is centered around computer vision and camera-radar
                fusion
                applications. During my academic journey, I've developed a passion for software development, and I had
                the
                privilege of completing a six-month internship at Titan Technology. There, I gained hands-on experience
                in
                front-end and back-end development using Vue3 and C#, including UI/UX design and API development. In
                parallel with my studies, I've been actively involved in Flask web development projects and autonomous
                driving feature enhancements.

                I embody enthusiasm and proactivity, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and take on new
                challenges.
                My proficiency extends to C++, Python, and various web development languages such as HTML and CSS.
                Currently, I'm diving deep into the realm of computer vision and object detection, while also
                familiarizing
                myself with Docker to elevate my development efficiency.</p>
