        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Stanny Ho, a master's student in the Department of
          Electronic Engineering at the National Taiwan University of Science
          and Technology. My research is centered around computer vision and
          camera-radar fusion applications. During my academic journey, I've
          developed a passion for software development, and I had the privilege
          of completing a six-month internship at Titan Technology. There, I
          gained hands-on experience in front-end and back-end development using
          Vue3 and C#, including UI/UX design and API development. In parallel
          with my studies, I've been actively involved in Flask web development
          projects and autonomous driving feature enhancements. I embody
          enthusiasm and proactivity, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge
          and take on new challenges. My proficiency extends to C++, Python, and
          various web development languages such as HTML and CSS. Currently, I'm
          diving deep into the realm of computer vision and object detection,
          while also familiarizing myself with Docker to elevate my development
          efficiency.
